# Project 3

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


I've included my templates in my templates folder containing files for index page, login page, sign up page and verifying email page. I've put my styles and images in static folder in two seperated folders named styles and images. The main python code is in views.py and the other files are obvious ! And also I have the verify email for my personal touch. Thanks a lot for your consideration.
